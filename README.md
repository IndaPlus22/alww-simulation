Chapter 1 ✔️
Basic Ecosystem project ✔️

## Running all the features

Use `cargo run` to run the program.
The Ecosystem project is the default as it uses almost all the conceptecs introduces in the chapter.
Running the other features required commenting in and out the right code which is a pain.
Stick to ecosystem please.

However, if you are so inclined you may use the other features by commenting in and out the out commented code in the `draw` and `update` functions in `lib.rs`
